# MainActivity-error-as-red-in-Xml-file-or-Mainactivity-not-found
Error solution
Tried all method to remove it re-build ,clear ,run main activity,adding codes to manifest.
this is not a error in your codes uh can open a project which uh have already built and is in working condition.
That will also show the same error.
So the Solution is 
Open User folder that was in my case:
C:\Users\<Your Pc UserName>\
Delete Folder named as:
.AndroidStudio<version something like 3.0 ,3.1 like version will be shown>
Restart Android Studio
PROBLEM SOLVED HOPE IT WILL WORK 
As It Worked for ME :)
